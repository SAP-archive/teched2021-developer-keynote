# Using git commit hooks

What's the adage, why spent 2 minutes doing something when you can spend 2 hours automating it?

I keep getting reminded to make sure I format my files and organize imports but I find it so annoying to constantly have to remember to run those commands on every file I touch. So instead of spending the few seconds to remember before every commit, I decided to spend an hour setting up commit hooks, like any good developer would.

Just watch this.

(DEMO) -> _Show VS Code with very poorly formatted file. Make small change, save then push commit. Show properly formatted file after._

I save so much mental energy by just hooking everything up so I don't even have to bother. Neither does anyone else since it's in the repo! Lazy developers for the win!
