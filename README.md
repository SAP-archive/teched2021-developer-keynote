# SAP TechEd 2021 Developer Keynote - Improving Developers' Lives

## Description

Join the SAP Developer Advocates and friends as they highlight SAP technologies with a clear focus on features that accelerate the development process, improve the developer experience and increases developer productivity and efficiency when developing end to end solutions or extending existing applications.  Several aspects of application development will be represented including: AI/ML, ABAP, CAP, Data & Analytics, Low-Code/No-Code.

## Content

In the context of the Developer Keynote, the content here is presented in the form of bite-sized sections, each one with a different angle, but all of them are focused on the same thing - making developers' lives better. The sections have been designed to be consumed quickly on the first pass, but are rich with layers that can be explored over time.

The fun thing this year is that the sections are on different topics, and stand independently, so you can consume them in any order, and dive in to the ones that speak to you.

### Sections

Here are those sections, in no particular order.

* [Command Line Magic](section/command-line-magic/) - learn how the command line is a powerful and scriptable environment that can help you get your job done faster, more directly, and perhaps most importantly, in a way that you can automate and customize. The primary focus for this section is on the CLI tool for the SAP Business Technology Platform - the BTP CLI.

* [ABAP Goodness](section/abap-goodness/) - learn how SAP S/4HANA Cloud customers and partners can extend SAP functionality in a cloud-ready way while continuing to keep the core clean by leveraging Embedded Steampunk.

* [SAP Fiori elements apps for OData V4](section/frontend) - explore the code that leverages the flexible programming model to extend SAP Fiori elements apps for OData V4. This projects build on an existing CAP demo that can be found in this repo as well.

* [SAP Cloud Application Programming Model Consuming Remote Services](section/cap) - In this demo we show how CAP can also be used to consume Remote Service. From importing the service definition, to creating extended entities that are mixture of remote service and local persistenence, to coding the logic to make this all work; you will find all of this in this CAP example project.

* [Low / No Code Development](section/low_no_code) - For this demo section, we see how the new SAP offerings in both Low and No Code development offer the opportunity to expand how much content can be delivered to a business. Either through improving the productivity of professional developers or creating opportunities for citizen developers or business builders; the expanded possibilites are impressive.
