# Adding and customizing a web application to the existing CAP project

This code builds on an exising CAP project that was created [in another demo](../cap). In addition, this project contains a customized SAP Fiori elements List Report Object Page application.
The innovative approach that was taken here, was the usage of the SAP Fiori tools to apply extensions from the [flexible programming model for SAP Fiori elements apps](https://blogs.sap.com/2021/08/19/leverage-the-flexible-programming-model-to-extend-your-sap-fiori-elements-apps-for-odata-v4/).
