# Demo flow

FYI this is WIP and might change in the next few days.


Intro: Tom build a really nice backend service that is a meshup of an SFSF API and a CAP application. But the problem with "nice APIs" is that business users just don't appreciate them.
What they really appreciate is a nicely integrated SAP Fiori App that follow established best practise but also provide all data possibly needed. 
And that's what I've build this week.

1. Start CAP service locally with `cds watch`
2. Use the Fiori tools to add a basic LR app
3. Add some annotations to display basic data and headers in the able
4. Add a custom section with Fiori tools
5. Show Flexible Programming Model Explorer
6. Add two custom sections
