# Introduction

# Open Questions

* What can we do with just the free tier.  Is it realistic that we ONLY use free tier software?

# Concept/Style

* Big Brother:  Group of developers living in a house together, attempting challenges/games, etc.  Confessionals should be part of the show as well.  Opening scenes showing each topic focus getting a key to the house?  HEad of Household, Developer/Code up for eviction, veto competition, reward competition.

# Possible Themes

* End-to-End solution?  Focus on building a solution which leverages many parts of SAP BTP.
* Accelerate Developers.  Focus on key development aspects which accelerate the development experience, this would be low-code/no code heavy.
* Make Developers Lives Better.  Focus on key features in various development tooling which make developers more productive
