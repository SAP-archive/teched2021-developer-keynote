# Introduction

Making Developers' Lives Better

Highlight SAP technologies with a clear focus on features that accelerate the development process, improve the developer experience and increases developer productivity and efficiency when developing end to end solutions or extending existing applications.  
* Several aspects of application development will be represented including:  AI/ML,  ABAP, CAP, Data & Analytics, Low-Code/No-Code.

Deliver this message in a fun and weird way that attempts to grab hold of the viewer’s attention.
* We will parody the concept of “Big Brother”.  This is a globally-known popular reality television show where strangers are brought into a house to live together without any external stimulus.  Confessionals/diary scences will be mechanism for tech topic delivery.  Opening should probably parody Big Brother opening.
* 12 Developers put in a house with no outside access (no Google search) and asked to work together to develop SAP BTP based application

| TBD | Narrator | | |
| Mamikee | Host | | |
| DJ | House Guest | CLIs for BTP, SAP Graph, etc | With command line tools from SAP I get to operate in the most powerful and flexible environment - the shell. I can build simple tools to script and automate, and have zero friction between me and what I'm using. SAP's cloud-first approach means all the services I'm using and platforms I'm building on are is there directly at my fingertips via the native environment of cloud - the command line. There's CLI tools for SAP Business Technology Platform, SAP Graph, CAP and more. In addition, show the Cloud Foundry and K8s CLI tools, and do it all in the Business Application Studio terminal.| [Script](https://github.com/SAP-samples/teched2021-developer-keynote/blob/main/drafts/CLI_power.md)| [Video](https://sap.sharepoint.com/sites/100499/advocates/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2F100499%2Fadvocates%2FShared%20Documents%2F203%2DProjects%2FTechEd%202021%2FKeynote%20Videos%2Fdja%2Dcli%2Dpower%2Emp4&parent=%2Fsites%2F100499%2Fadvocates%2FShared%20Documents%2F203%2DProjects%2FTechEd%202021%2FKeynote%20Videos&p=true&originalPath=aHR0cHM6Ly9zYXAuc2hhcmVwb2ludC5jb20vOnY6L3MvMTAwNDk5L2Fkdm9jYXRlcy9FV3h5djNNNE9rUk50d1A1NDk3dThaTUJyemlGRXQzVnhuME1WUlZoQXBjYUV3P3J0aW1lPUk3Wmhtby1DMlVn)|
| Josh | House Guest | CI/CD and other platform / runtime facilities (e.g. Piper)? | A showcase of CI/CD on BTP (possibly Piper Blue Ocean).  Setup in the BTP cockpit of a user needing to make an application change.  Show how app is running and connected to Kyma.  Kyma would signal CI/CD when a new push of an application change is made by a developer.  Show the visualization of a failure and a success if there is time in the 4 minutes. | [Script](https://github.com/SAP-samples/teched2021-developer-keynote/blob/main/drafts/kyma_CI-CD) | |
| Kevin | House Guest  | iOS/ARKit | A simple ARKit application displaying the new SAP Fiori for iOS ARAnnotation Cards. Show the benefit of using the SAP ARKit package as no 3D modelling is needed to get an AR experience, AR controls are provided by SAP in an Open Source manner through Swift Packages. The API is easy to consume and an AR experience can be achieved with ease.  | [Script](https://github.com/SAP-samples/teched2021-developer-keynote/blob/main/drafts/FioriARKitDemo/FioriARKit_Demo.md) | |
| Katharina | House Guest  | AI/ML | Will showcase how easy it is to get started with the AI Business Services ( DAR, STI, BER ). Show the setup of one of the AI Business Service by using booster and starting with a free plan ( afterwards I'll switch to standard plan). Furthermore I want to show the new AI API and its SDK (new standard API for the AI Capabilities) and will demo of how to use it and how easy you can train a model and do inferences. Today all our AI Business Services have different APIs which makes it not easy to consume, this will change with the new AI API. | [Script](https://github.com/SAP-samples/teched2021-developer-keynote/blob/main/drafts/FirstStepsAI.md)| [Video](https://sap.sharepoint.com/:v:/r/sites/100499/advocates/Shared%20Documents/203-Projects/TechEd%202021/Keynote%20Videos/dev_keynote_ai_draft.mp4?csf=1&web=1&e=Bg07Pn) |

# Script Draft
  
Opening - Mamikee outside of the TechEdhouse opening the show.  Set the mission of the house. Why are we altogether.  We brought these developers together in the TechEdhouse to see how they can make developers lives' better by introducing new tools and techniques to each other and the audience.  Short description of what happened previously?  Now its time for another check in on all the developers as they influence each other by showcasing their demos.   From ABAP to iOS development, the developers will cover a lot of different topics.   I remember when <name> and <name> got in an arguement about <topic1>, now lets show you really want <name> was trying to explain. 
  
Throw to DJ demo.  Before leaving confessional, DJ says, gotta go cook dinner for these folks since no one else will do it.  On his way out Vitalij comes in. 
  
Throw to Vitalij demo.  Starts by saying,  finally DJ is out of here I can show you my demo. Now done with demo,  goes to pantry to see if the beer is restocked, where Michele is just grabbing the last beer and walking out.  Vitaji stares as the last beer walks away. Cut to michele to confession, cracking the beer.
  
Throw to Micheles demo.   Sits down and says.. "you gotta be quicker than that", and smiles to the camera.  Starts demo.  Finishes, stands up and says guess I'll go take a nap till dinner is ready. Goes to the bedroom, turns on the light.  Wakes up Kevin in the process. Kevin says, well so much for my nap, leaves to confession.

Cut back to Vitalij still standing in pantry not finding any more beer.   
  
Throw to Kevin demo.  Kevin comes in to confession, groggy and a little annoyed. Goes into his demo.  Leaves confessional and heads gym, where rich is just getting off treadmill,  Kevin says,  oh so someone else can use the treadmill now??  Thanks dude.  Rich says,  well I had to get my 10k in today.
  
Throw to Rich demo.   Rich says, can you believe that guy,  I've seen him on the treadmill like twice since we've been here.  Rich goes into demo.  Guess I'll head to the shower before dinner.  Quick life hack.  Grab your own towel cuz no one does any laundry. Passes josh in the hallway, says "so I guess the sink is blue again?".  Cut to shot of Rich at sink which is stained blue.

Cut back to Vitalij still looking for beer in the pantry. Arms folded staring. 
  
Throw to  Marius demo.  Says,  so I had to come in here to get some peace and quiet.  That guy talks way too much. Goes into demo.  Marius comes out of the confession as katharina approaches, he asks Katharina if she has seen the loud guy with the blue beard.  She says no, he says ok good, I'll go setup the table for dinner. 
  
Throw to Katharinas demo.   "I don't know what his problem is with Josh, he knew he was coming into a house with 9 other developers".   Goes into demo.  Walks passed the laundry area, where she sees Thomas J folding his laundry.  Says to him,  you know, my stuff needs folded too if you have time.  Tom says... well its almost dinner time, but sure I'll take care of it, make sure they leave some dinner for me.  
  
Throw to Tom demo.  Tom enters confessional with a stack of folded laundry, a litle annoyed, says " i need to learn how to say no". Goes into demo.  Finishes demo and grabs his laundry and stands up and says,  "they better not have ate without me again".   
  
Throw to Thomas Grassl demo.  Thomas G sitting in the dining area alone, waiting for dinner time, looking at his watch. the table set, no one is there. Show Grassl as shrugging off annoyance.

Cut back to Vitalij still looking for beer.

Cut back "outside of house" and Mamikee says.. "This is a good time to recap.... yada yada yada"
  
 
  

# Big Brother Research

* No phones, no internet, no comms to outside world. (can we play on this aspects - like how can developers possibly code without access to Google Search?)  (<-- use the built-in `man` pages on the command line, obvs ;-))
* 16 House Guests(HG)
* 94 Cameras
* 100 ish mics
* Host on stage outside of house, once HGs are in the house, seems like the host stays out and only interacts over voice over.
* Narrator
* House Guests play for cash prize
* Transistions from shot to shot seem to be a lot of "flash" or "starburst"

Show Flow S23E01 - Watch [here!](https://www.cbs.com/shows/big_brother/video/Lz8gWBWdDN83XFX9Xm_A7d0tT_iBPPqp/big-brother-episode-1/)
* First 4 men finds keys to the house during some personal activity at home.  This is followed by a short bio.  Then the first 4 men are shown
standing on the stage outside of the house with the host with some short chatting as they enter the house. Once inside the house, they are told
to go to the "Backyard" for the first challenge.  During this time, each guest breaks off to a short confessional style shot where they are talking
about their stradegy.  Once in the backyard they are presented with a challenge, and the winner becomes elidgable to compete to become head of household(HOH).
This process is repeated another 3 times, with the first 4 woomen, then the second set of 4 men, and the second set of 4 women.  The winners of the 4 seperate
are now reveiled to be the team captians, 4 teams of 4.  As cards and/or casino games seem to be a theme here, the teams are named for card suites,  Jokers, Aces,
Kings, and Queens.  Each captain now drafts his/her team members based on the BB slot machine which offers two choices to the captains. Now that the teams are set,
the HOH compedition takes place where the winner and his team are awarded ammunity from eviction for that week. Last place becomes the "have-nots" where they are
punished with cold showers, lame food, lame rooms, etc.

* This year is different (higher prize of $750k instead of $500k last 22 years). ALso the 4 member teams is a new twist.  It will only last until people voted off make the other teams so small they have to consolidate.  Producers do stuff like this to cause inter-team spying and alliances that may or may not last.  Anyway, a new twist but that is what keeps people interested year after year.  

* Some things to think about when watching a clique of like minded people form is how can we poke fun at developers or code in a way that a group of houseguest would poke fun at one another.  We can't cross a line but we can say someone is on team ABAP and they always leave the seat up in the bathroom or don't lock the door to the bathroom, cause they aren't focused on security...  Team Kyma could always be looking to gather support or intel to win a competition because they beliieve in being open and having community involement.  Another code group or indivdual like Appgyver/low code is claiming the kitchen as their space cause they have the best recipes to make meals following simple step by step templates and meals that could be put in a box and mailed to a non-chef.  


Show Flow S23E02 - Watch [here!](https://www.cbs.com/shows/big_brother/video/eqdH0tKoFGhrwTwEtHnkS1_fJx_ngdJI/big-brother-episode-2/)

* First scene shows all 16 exploring the house and engaging with each other. Random confessionals(diary room) shots mixed in.  Everyone sits down on couch and they do a round robin, who they are where they are from, etc.  At one point,  HOH talks directly to one of the “Hidden” cameras(this is not part of a confessional).  Have-nots are shown their bedroom, beds are  trailer, jetski, etc.  Shown that they will eat BB slop for the week.  Various scenes of HOH talking with the house guests in small groups or one-on-one, promising them that they are safe form eviction this week.  HOH sits down with one of the men that he wants to put up with eviction and has a heart to heart with him.  After talking with him, HOH changes his mind about putting him up for eviction.   HOH explains the wildcard competition.  Each week 3 teams(HOH team is safe) elect one person to compete.   Winner can guarantee safety for him/her.   Teams start to discuss who will compete, confessionals breaking in at times as well.  House guests regroup and the players are announced.  Players have to search a trashed room for keys, wallet, and phone in shortest amount of time.   Players are dressed in 80s club gear?  They have to be quiet, and are penalized points if too loud. Breaks to confessional while player is shown doing the task.   Back to the group where HOH goes over the scoring and timing. Winner is announced.  Winner now spins a wheel to determine how many of his/her team is safe this week.  Winner picks which member of his team will be safe.  HOH primary target for eviction is now safe, and HOH doesn’t know what to do with his nominations now. Shown wondering around the house.  HOH sits down with various house guests and asked if anyone has been approach about an alliance.  Next, is the nomination ceremony, group comes together around a table.  HOH nominates 2 guests for eviction.
