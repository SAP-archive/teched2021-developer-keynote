# Introduction

# Open Questions

* What can we do with just the free tier.  Is it realistic that we ONLY use free tier software?

# Concept/Style

* Big Brother:  Group of developers living in a house together, attempting challenges/games, etc.  Confessionals should be part of the show as well.  Opening scenes showing each topic focus getting a key to the house?  HEad of Household, Developer/Code up for eviction, veto competition, reward competition.

# Possible Themes

* End-to-End solution?  Focus on building a solution which leverages many parts of SAP BTP.
* Accelerate Developers.  Focus on key development aspects which accelerate the development experience, this would be low-code/no code heavy.
* Make Developers Lives Better.  Focus on key features in various development tooling which make developers more productive

# Research Big Brother 

* No phones, no internet, no comms to outside world. 
* 16 House Guests(HG)
* 94 Cameras
* 100 ish mics
* Host on stage outside of house, once HGs are in the house, seems like the host stays out and only interacts over voice over.
* Narrator
* House Guests play for cash prize
* Transistions from shot to shot seem to be a lot of "flash" or "starburst"

Show Flow S23E01
* First 4 men finds keys to the house during some personal activity at home.  This is followed by a short bio.  Then the first 4 men are shown 
standing on the stage outside of the house with the host with some short chatting as they enter the house. Once inside the house, they are told
to go to the "Backyard" for the first challenge.  During this time, each guest breaks off to a short confessional style shot where they are talking
about their stradegy.  Once in the backyard they are presented with a challenge, and the winner becomes elidgable to compete to become head of household(HOH).
This process is repeated another 3 times, with the first 4 woomen, then the second set of 4 men, and the second set of 4 women.  The winners of the 4 seperate
are now reveiled to be the team captians, 4 teams of 4.  As cards and/or casino games seem to be a theme here, the teams are named for card suites,  Jokers, Aces,
Kings, and Queens.  Each captain now drafts his/her team members based on the BB slot machine which offers two choices to the captains. Now that the teams are set,
the HOH compedition takes place where the winner and his team are awarded ammunity from eviction for that week. Last place becomes the "have-nots" where they are 
punished with cold showers, lame food, lame rooms, etc.
