# Introduction

# Open Questions

# Concept/Style

* Big Brother:  Group of developers living in a house together.  Confessionals/diary scences will be mechanism for tech topic delivery.  Opening should probably parity Big Brother opening.

# Themes

* Make Developers Lives Better.  Focus on key features in various development tooling which make developers more productive

| Rich | House Guest | ABAP | Will showcase "Embedded Steampunk".  First show how to access S4/HANA data from steampunk using the side-car approach.  Then show how to access the same data with a simple SELECT statement leveraging "Embedded Steampunk" within the S4/HANA system |

# Script Draft

# Big Brother Research

* No phones, no internet, no comms to outside world. (can we play on this aspects - like how can developers possibly code without access to Google Search?) 
* 16 House Guests(HG)
* 94 Cameras
* 100 ish mics
* Host on stage outside of house, once HGs are in the house, seems like the host stays out and only interacts over voice over.
* Narrator
* House Guests play for cash prize
* Transistions from shot to shot seem to be a lot of "flash" or "starburst"

* First 4 men finds keys to the house during some personal activity at home.  This is followed by a short bio.  Then the first 4 men are shown 
standing on the stage outside of the house with the host with some short chatting as they enter the house. Once inside the house, they are told
to go to the "Backyard" for the first challenge.  During this time, each guest breaks off to a short confessional style shot where they are talking
about their stradegy.  Once in the backyard they are presented with a challenge, and the winner becomes elidgable to compete to become head of household(HOH).
This process is repeated another 3 times, with the first 4 woomen, then the second set of 4 men, and the second set of 4 women.  The winners of the 4 seperate
are now reveiled to be the team captians, 4 teams of 4.  As cards and/or casino games seem to be a theme here, the teams are named for card suites,  Jokers, Aces,
Kings, and Queens.  Each captain now drafts his/her team members based on the BB slot machine which offers two choices to the captains. Now that the teams are set,
the HOH compedition takes place where the winner and his team are awarded ammunity from eviction for that week. Last place becomes the "have-nots" where they are 
punished with cold showers, lame food, lame rooms, etc.

* This year is different (higher prize of $750k instead of $500k last 22 years). ALso the 4 member teams is a new twist.  It will only last until people voted off make the other teams so small they have to consolidate.  Producers do stuff like this to cause inter-team spying and alliances that may or may not last.  Anyway, a new twist but that is what keeps people interested year after year.  

* Some things to think about when watching a clique of like minded people form is how can we poke fun at developers or code in a way that a group of houseguest would poke fun at one another.  We can't cross a line but we can say someone is on team ABAP and they always leave the seat up in the bathroom or don't lock the door to the bathroom, cause they aren't focused on security...  Team Kyma could always be looking to gather support or intel to win a competition because they beliieve in being open and having community involement.  Another code group or indivdual like Appgyver/low code is claiming the kitchen as their space cause they have the best recipes to make meals following simple step by step templates and meals that could be put in a box and mailed to a non-chef.

* First scene shows all 16 exploring the house and engaging with each other. Random confessionals(diary room) shots mixed in.  Everyone sits down on couch and they do a round robin, who they are where they are from, etc.  At one point,  HOH talks directly to one of the “Hidden” cameras(this is not part of a confessional).  Have-nots are shown their bedroom, beds are  trailer, jetski, etc.  Shown that they will eat BB slop for the week.  Various scenes of HOH talking with the house guests in small groups or one-on-one, promising them that they are safe form eviction this week.  HOH sits down with one of the men that he wants to put up with eviction and has a heart to heart with him.  After talking with him, HOH changes his mind about putting him up for eviction.   HOH explains the wildcard competition.  Each week 3 teams(HOH team is safe) elect one person to compete.   Winner can guarantee safety for him/her.   Teams start to discuss who will compete, confessionals breaking in at times as well.  House guests regroup and the players are announced.  Players have to search a trashed room for keys, wallet, and phone in shortest amount of time.   Players are dressed in 80s club gear?  They have to be quiet, and are penalized points if too loud. Breaks to confessional while player is shown doing the task.   Back to the group where HOH goes over the scoring and timing. Winner is announced.  Winner now spins a wheel to determine how many of his/her team is safe this week.  Winner picks which member of his team will be safe.  HOH primary target for eviction is now safe, and HOH doesn’t know what to do with his nominations now. Shown wondering around the house.  HOH sits down with various house guests and asked if anyone has been approach about an alliance.  Next, is the nomination ceremony, group comes together around a table.  HOH nominates 2 guests for eviction.
