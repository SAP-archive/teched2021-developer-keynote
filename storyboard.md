# Introduction

# Open Questions

* What can we do with just the free tier.  Is it realistic that we ONLY use free tier software?

# Concept/Style

* Big Brother:  Group of developers living in a house together, attempting challenges/games, etc.  Confessionals should be part of the show as well.  Opening scenes showing each topic focus getting a key to the house?  HEad of Household, Developer/Code up for eviction, veto competition, reward competition.

# Possible Themes

* End-to-End solution?  Focus on building a solution which leverages many parts of SAP BTP.
* Accelerate Developers.  Focus on key development aspects which accelerate the development experience, this would be low-code/no code heavy.
* Make Developers Lives Better.  Focus on key features in various development tooling which make developers more productive

# Big Brother Research

* No phones, no internet, no comms to outside world. (can we play on this aspects - like how can developers possibly code without access to Google Search?) 
* 16 House Guests(HG)
* 94 Cameras
* 100 ish mics
* Host on stage outside of house, once HGs are in the house, seems like the host stays out and only interacts over voice over.
* Narrator
* House Guests play for cash prize
* Transistions from shot to shot seem to be a lot of "flash" or "starburst"

Show Flow S23E01 - Watch [here!](https://www.cbs.com/shows/big_brother/video/Lz8gWBWdDN83XFX9Xm_A7d0tT_iBPPqp/big-brother-episode-1/)
* First 4 men finds keys to the house during some personal activity at home.  This is followed by a short bio.  Then the first 4 men are shown 
standing on the stage outside of the house with the host with some short chatting as they enter the house. Once inside the house, they are told
to go to the "Backyard" for the first challenge.  During this time, each guest breaks off to a short confessional style shot where they are talking
about their stradegy.  Once in the backyard they are presented with a challenge, and the winner becomes elidgable to compete to become head of household(HOH).
This process is repeated another 3 times, with the first 4 woomen, then the second set of 4 men, and the second set of 4 women.  The winners of the 4 seperate
are now reveiled to be the team captians, 4 teams of 4.  As cards and/or casino games seem to be a theme here, the teams are named for card suites,  Jokers, Aces,
Kings, and Queens.  Each captain now drafts his/her team members based on the BB slot machine which offers two choices to the captains. Now that the teams are set,
the HOH compedition takes place where the winner and his team are awarded ammunity from eviction for that week. Last place becomes the "have-nots" where they are 
punished with cold showers, lame food, lame rooms, etc.

This year is different (higher prize of $750k instead of $500k last 22 years). ALso the 4 member teams is a new twist.  It will only last until people voted off make the other teams so small they have to consolidate.  Producers do stuff like this to cause inter-team spying and alliances that may or may not last.  Anyway, a new twist but that is what keeps people interested year after year.  

Some things to think about when watching a clique of like minded people form is how can we poke fun at developers or code in a way that a group of houseguest would poke fun at one another.  We can't cross a line but we can say someone is on team ABAP and they always leave the seat up in the bathroom or don't lock the door to the bathroom, cause they aren't focused on security...  Team Kyma could always be looking to gather support or intel to win a competition because they beliieve in being open and having community involement.  Another code group or indivdual like Appgyver/low code is claiming the kitchen as their space cause they have the best recipes to make meals following simple step by step templates and meals that could be put in a box and mailed to a non-chef.
